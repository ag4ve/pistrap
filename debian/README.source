pistrap for Debian
------------------

<pistrap.sh - Bootstraps your own minimal RaspberryPi SD-card image, supporting various dists,arches and suites. The tool will also download, configure, and install the latest RPi firmware, kernel module etc... It has a nice whiptail-based interface for interactive use, and a pistrap_mini variant without the whiptail interface, which can be easialy scriptable, for use with i.e. pistrap-web, a python-based web interface for kicking off jobs.>
